Important files

For Homework 1, the main file is [build_test_LM.py](https://github.com/mxchai/cs3245_homework/blob/master/hw1/build_test_LM.py), which is responsible for building the language model needed to guess the queries' respective languages.

For Homework 3, the main files are [index.py](https://github.com/mxchai/cs3245_homework/blob/master/hw3/index.py), which indexes the NLTK corpus and outputs the dictionary and the postings file, and [search.py](https://github.com/mxchai/cs3245_homework/blob/master/hw3/search.py), which reads in the queries and find the most relevant documents.
