1. In the homework assignment, we are using character-based ngrams,
i.e., the gram units are characters. Do you expect token-based ngram
models to perform better?

I would expect token-based ngrams models to be better.


2. What do you think will happen if we provided more data for each
category for you to build the language models? What if we only
provided more data for Indonesian?

With more data, the accuracy of each categorisation will improve. 

3. What do you think will happen if you strip out punctuations and/or
numbers? What about converting upper case characters to lower case?

Can test out the function

4. We use 4-gram models in this homework assignment. What do you think
will happen if we varied the ngram size, such as using unigrams,
bigrams and trigrams?

I think the accuracy of the categorization will drop.
